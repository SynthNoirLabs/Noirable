# Product Definition: synthNoirUI

## Initial Concept
**synthNoirUI**: A hybrid UI generation platform combining Google's A2UI protocol for rapid, secure, declarative UI drafting with a "Lovable-style" code generation engine for exporting to fully editable React code. The system features a "Draft Mode" (A2UI) for speed and consistency, and an "Eject Mode" for full code ownership.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Frontend Developers.
- **Nature of Project:** A personal exploration project designed to be fun and experimental. It is not intended for commercial production but rather to test the capabilities of hybrid UI generation architectures.

## Core Goals
1.  **Rapid Exploration:** Enable developers to instantly visualize UI concepts using a secure, declarative JSON protocol (A2UI) without writing boilerplate code.
2.  **Seamless Ejection:** Provide a one-click "Eject" mechanism that transforms the abstract A2UI definition into a concrete, self-contained React file.
3.  **Hybrid Architecture:** Successfully implement and demonstrate the bridge between a rigid UI protocol and flexible code generation.

## Key Features
-   **AI-Driven Command Center:** A natural language chat interface where users describe their desired interface (e.g., "Create a suspect dossier card"), and the system generates the corresponding A2UI JSON.
-   **Split-Pane "Detective's Desk":** A live workspace featuring the raw A2UI JSON on one side and the instantly rendered UI on the other, allowing for manual tweaking or AI-driven updates.
-   **"Eject" to Code:** A robust transformation engine that compiles the current state into a single, copy-pasteable React component file using Tailwind CSS.

## Visual Identity & Design Guidelines
-   **Theme:** "Detective Noir" meets "Synth".
-   **Atmosphere:** Moody, low-key lighting, heavy use of shadows and silhouetted forms.
-   **Palette:** Muted grays, deep blacks, sepia tones, accented by occasional sharp, neon hints (like a neon sign reflecting in a rainy puddle).
-   **Typography:** A blend of typewriter-style serif fonts (for headers/accents) and clean sans-serif (for code/UI) to evoke the feeling of reviewing case files.
