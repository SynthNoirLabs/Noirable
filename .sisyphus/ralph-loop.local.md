Complete all of these with good quality, tests, docs, and proper code quality
| Undo/Redo | Users will accidentally overwrite evidence. Simple stack in Zustand. |
| Keyboard shortcuts | Cmd+Enter to send, Cmd+E to eject, Cmd+Z undo. Power user appeal. |
| Evidence search/filter | As history grows, finding old evidence gets hard. Simple text search. |
| Template library | Pre-built A2UI templates (form, dashboard, card layouts). Reduces cold-start friction. |
| Live Sandpack preview | From roadmap. Users can tweak exported code and see it run. Huge for experimentation. |
| Prompt history | Save/recall successful prompts. "Show me that form I made last week." |
| Export to file | Download .tsx or .zip directly instead of just clipboard. |
| Loading states | Show skeleton/spinner while AI generates. Currently feels unresponsive. |
| Error recovery UI | When AI fails, offer "Try again" button with context. |
And think and propose a skeletin n how the ai fine tunning could be imlemented here
