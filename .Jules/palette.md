## 2024-05-22 - Accessible Typewriter Effects

**Learning:** Animated typewriter text is a nightmare for screen readers if not handled correctly. They may announce every character update or nothing at all. Additionally, resetting the animation on every streamed chunk creates a jarring visual flicker.
**Action:** Always duplicate the full content in an `sr-only` element for screen readers, and hide the animated version with `aria-hidden="true"`. For streaming text, ensure the animation logic detects appended content and continues smoothly instead of restarting.

## 2026-02-24 - Accessible Loading States

**Learning:** Loading indicators like pulsing dots are often ignored by screen readers if they lack ARIA roles, leaving users unsure if the system is processing.
**Action:** Wrap loading indicators in a container with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to ensure the status is announced without interrupting the user.

## 2024-05-24 - Accessible Search Feedback

**Learning:** Filtering lists without explicit feedback leaves screen reader users guessing. Simply updating the DOM isn't enough; they need to know _how many_ items remain.
**Action:** Add a dedicated `sr-only` live region (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`) that explicitly announces "Found X items" or "No matches" whenever the filter changes.

## 2025-05-23 - Keyboard Accessible Splitters

**Learning:** Custom resize handles (`role="separator"`) are not keyboard accessible by default. Users relying on keyboards cannot adjust panel sizes without explicit `tabIndex` and `onKeyDown` handlers.
**Action:** Ensure all interactive separators have `tabIndex={0}`, handle `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` for adjustment, and `Home`/`End` for min/max snapping. Add visible focus indicators (`focus-visible:ring`) to guide keyboard users.

## 2026-04-14 - Accessible Layout Controls

**Learning:** Keyboard users often rely on visual cues (focus rings) to understand which control is currently active when tabbing through interfaces. Without explicit focus states, layout controls are virtually invisible during keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Add standardized focus states (e.g., `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[var(--aesthetic-accent)] focus-visible:outline-none`) to interactive layout components like toolbars and desk controls to improve keyboard accessibility.
