**Learning:** Animated typewriter text is a nightmare for screen readers if not handled correctly. They may announce every character update or nothing at all. Additionally, resetting the animation on every streamed chunk creates a jarring visual flicker.
**Action:** Always duplicate the full content in an `sr-only` element for screen readers, and hide the animated version with `aria-hidden="true"`. For streaming text, ensure the animation logic detects appended content and continues smoothly instead of restarting.
